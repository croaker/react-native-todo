# React Native To-Do List App

This is a very simple to-do list app that serves as an introduction to
react native.

It has been initialized using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
and works without Xcode or Android Studio. Have a look at
`create-react-native-app`'s [User Guide](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md) to get started.
